I was getting frustrated trying to replicate the React project being demonstrated and worked out in the scrimba platform in my local environment in visual studio because I was using CDNs to run React and the scrimba videos weren't.  I was having trouble importing/exporting things and just generally sensed that I wasn't really doing React properly, not having really set it up fully.  It took a while to get React working on my computer but I enventually was able to figure it out thanks to some tutorials!  Simply swapping out the default Vite 'app' and css files for the ones I'd been working on in scrimba's platform did not work, but I gradually modified the exisiting demo app with my own code until all the components and styling I'd had in the other version worked.  I borrowed the React logo from the demo app becuase I liked the animation that happens when you mouse over it.
