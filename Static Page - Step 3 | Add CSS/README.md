The JS/JSX of this remains essentially the same as the Step 2 project, aside from adding a navbar and reconfiguring the display properties of the elements (goodbye CSS grid).  Did some restyling of the page in CSS and learned how to use a custom typeface.  Couldn't figure out how to link to the font --> had to download it and host it locally in the project folder...  Would like to figure out liking to a font later
