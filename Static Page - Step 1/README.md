This was the assigment from scrimba:
```
Challenge: Starting from scratch, build and render the 
HTML for our section project. Check the Google slide for 
what you're trying to build.

We'll be adding styling to it later.

Hints:
* The React logo is a file in the project tree, so you can
  access it by using `src="./react-logo.png" in your image
  element
* You can also set the `width` attribute of the image element
  just like in HTML. In the slide, I have it set to 40px
 */
```

Fairly straightforward... I used custom components rather than coding out the whole site in one JSX unit (still figuring out the terminology --what's a JSX function called?  A Component?).  Figured out how to style a React element with CSS; used arrow functions instead of named functions.
